# Meteor Microscope
Midterm project for Bryant University, exploring Meteor.Js in a directed study. 

## About
Completed the Meteor Discover book, whilst pushing weekly updates to github. 
The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with a JavaScript framework, and the worlds most popular place to work together.

Any tips / comments / concerns are greatly appreciated. 

As I work through various other exercises I hope to expand this, including other fun aspects.
