This is my midterm project for school.

Complete the Meteor Discover book, whilst pushing weekly updates to github. Familiarizing myself with a framework and the worlds most popular place to work together.

Any tips / comments / concerns are greatly appreciated. As I work through various other exercises I hope to expand this, including other fun aspects.
